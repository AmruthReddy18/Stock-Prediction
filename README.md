**Stock Price Prediction**

This project involves predicting stock prices using machine learning techniques such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. The goal is to visualize actual stock prices and compare them with the predicted values to evaluate the model's performance.

**Overview**

In this project, I built a dashboard using Dash to visualize the stock prices of Tata Global Beverages Ltd (NSE: TATAGLOBAL). The dashboard includes:

A scatter plot of the actual closing prices and LSTM predicted closing prices.
A tab to view stock data of other companies such as Tesla, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft.

**Features**

Tab 1: NSE-TATAGLOBAL Stock Data

Actual Closing Price: Visualizes the actual closing price of Tata Global Beverages Ltd.
LSTM Predicted Closing Price: Compares the LSTM model's predicted closing price.
Tab 2: Facebook Stock Data

Visualizes high, low, and volume of Facebook stock data, with options to select other stocks like Tesla, Apple, and Microsoft.

**Tech Stack**

Dash: For creating the web-based dashboard.

Plotly: For generating the interactive graphs.

Pandas: For data manipulation and preparation.

LSTM (Keras): For time-series stock price prediction.

**Results**

The LSTM model was trained on historical stock price data and was able to predict future closing prices with reasonable accuracy. As shown in the graph above, the model closely follows the actual stock price trends.
